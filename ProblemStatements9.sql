-- Brian, the healthcare department, has requested for a report that shows for each state how many people underwent treatment 
-- for the disease “Autism”.  He expects the report to show the data for each state as well as each gender and for each state and gender 
-- combination. 
-- Prepare a report for Brian for his requirement.

#Problem Statement 2: 
-- Insurance companies want to evaluate the performance of different insurance plans they offer. 
-- Generate a report that shows each insurance plan, the company that issues the plan, and the number of treatments the plan was claimed 
-- for. The report would be more relevant if the data compares the performance for different years(2020, 2021 and 2022) and if the report 
-- also includes the total number of claims in the different years, as well as the total number of claims for each plan in all 3 years 
-- combined.

#Problem Statement 3:  
-- Sarah, from the healthcare department, is trying to understand if some diseases are spreading in a

-- and least treated diseases by the patients of that state in the year 2022. It would be helpful for 
-- Sarah if the aggregation for the different combinations is found as well. Assist Sarah to create this 
-- report.
